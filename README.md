# Fetch-API-basics

I`ve created a simple register app, fetching an API from the JSON Placeholder which all of you can use. App shows
you how to use fetch API to include data in your projects. You might noticed that im using ES6 version of JavaScript, which is far more easier than ES5. 
I also used scss stilization(you can find crash courses about it)which is also much easier to use than standard CSS. Be advised: You need to have separate folders for compiling scss to css

NOTE: Learn higher order array methods so that you can understand how it works! :)
